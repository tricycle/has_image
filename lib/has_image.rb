    # To use HasImage with a Rails model, all you have to do is add a column
    # named "has_image_file." For configuration defaults, you might want to take
    # a look at the default options specified in HasImage#default_options_for.
    # The different setting options are described below.
    # 
    # Options:
    # *  +:resize_to+ - Dimensions to resize to. This should be an aImageMagick {geometry string}[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#resize]. Fixed sizes are recommended.
    # *  +:thumbnails</tt> - A hash of thumbnail names and dimensions. The dimensions should be ImageMagick {geometry strings}[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#resize]. Fixed sized are recommended.
    # *  +:auto_generate_thumbnails+ - Flag to indicate whether to automatically generate thumbnails when the image_data changes (e.g. on create). If you set this to false, your application code needs to take care of generating Thumbnails, e.g. using +#generate_thumbnail+
    # *  +:delete+ - Flag to indicate if the images should be delete from the storage (e.g. the Filesystem) when the record is destroyed
    # *  +:min_size</tt> - Minimum file size allowed. It's recommended that you set this size in kilobytes.
    # *  +:max_size</tt> - Maximum file size allowed. It's recommended that you set this size in megabytes.
    # *  +:base_path</tt> - Where to install the images. You should probably leave this alone, except for tests.
    # *  +:path_prefix</tt> - Where to install the images, relative to basepath. You should probably leave this alone.
    # *  +:convert_to</tt> - An ImageMagick format to convert images to. Recommended formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF.
    # *  +:output_quality</tt> - Image output quality passed to ImageMagick.
    # *  +:invalid_image_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image data can't be processed.
    # *  +:image_too_small_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image file is too small. You should ideally set this to something that tells the user what the minimum is.
    # *  +:image_too_big_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image file is too big. You should ideally set this to something that tells the user what the maximum is.
